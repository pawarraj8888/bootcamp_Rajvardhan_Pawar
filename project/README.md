# Project

This is your *personal* project implementation (independent of the 6-stage homework notebooks).

## Layout
- `src/` — library code and pipelines
- `scripts/` — entry points/CLIs to run pipelines
- `data/` — raw/processed/interim (gitignore large files)
- `docs/` — design notes, diagrams, stakeholder context
- `configs/` — YAML/JSON configuration
- `artifacts/` — models, plots, reports
- `tests/` — unit/integration tests

## How to run
